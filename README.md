## React-MyScoreboard
This project is a table to hold a ranking of several players in any sport. Any player can be added and updated the result of each one. Their order of presentation is by score and the first has a winner icon.
The application is made in ReactJS and has no database connected, so when reloading the page the data is lost.<br>
